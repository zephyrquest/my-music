Once a violent soul
I fight no more
Pushed away the world
You closed that door
Once an exile
And now everything will change

But you remain
You stay behind
And blindly go
Towards the light

We try to fight what isn't real
My only weakness holds me still
Once an exile, I'm almost free
Stop thinking that you're more than me

Once your solemn voice
Would keep me sane
Now it's all I hear

Once you listened in
To comfort me
Now you wouldn't care

But you remain
You stay behind
And blindly go
Towards the light

We try to fight what isn't real
My only weakness holds me still
Once an exile, I'm almost free
Stop thinking that you're more than me
