There's a calling round the corner
And I know I'll abandon myself
All together it finally caves
Like a stain on the record I made

And I know
Who I want to be

Where is the colour that I need
Is it lost inside of me
I have been to the edge of myself
Where were you hiding anyway
Somewhere I can never be
I have been to the edge of myself

It's a solemn sense of burden
Like a weight on the ropes of my soul
Now I live in a gilded cage
Just a stain on the record I made

And I know
Who I want to be

Where is the colour that I need
Is it lost inside of me
I have been to the edge of myself
Where were you hiding anyway
Somewhere I can never be
I have been to the edge of myself

Where is the meaning in the rage
I just need to turn the page
Step away
From the edge
Of myself

Where is the colour that I need
Is it lost inside of me
I have been to the edge of myself
Where were you hiding anyway
Somewhere I can never be
I have been to the edge of myself
I have been to the edge of myself
I have been to the edge of myself
