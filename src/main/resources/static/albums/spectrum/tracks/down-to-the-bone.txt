I exhaust my options again
Until none of this makes any sense

And I thought that I could get by alone
When I wash my hands
I wear them down to the bone

Oh, I'm waiting but can people change
Is it going to go away
Oh, I swear that I can hear my name
It's never going to go away

When I lie at night
I reach for an empty space
When I think of your voice
I can almost see your face

And I thought that I could get by alone
When I wash my hands
I wear them down to the bone

Oh, I'm waiting but can people change
Is it going to go away
Oh, I swear that I can hear my name
It's never going to go away

Oh, I'm waiting but can people change
Is it going to go away
Oh, I swear that I can hear my name
It's never going to go away

Never going to go away
Can hear my name
Is it going to go away
Can people change
Is it going to go away
