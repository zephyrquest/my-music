It's an empty life to lead
Looking out on the world and not being whole
It's the deepest of fears, the hardest to bear
Not seeing you there

I close my eyes, close my eyes

You think you've lost all that matters
But you, you've never been so wrong
Turn it around, turn it around
Maybe you'll make it out
You'll make it out

I hear the scratches of an old familiar voice
And watch the shards as they fall beneath the ice
And when the fires rise, and start to consume
I know I can't be with you

It's not my time, not my time

You think you've lost all that matters
But you, you've never been so wrong
Turn it around, turn it around
Maybe you'll make it out
You'll make it out

You want it all
You can't have it all
It doesn't stop you trying
Cause I want it all
I can't have it all
It doesn't stop me holding on

You're all that matters
But you, you've never been so alone
Turn it around, turn it around
Maybe you'll make it out
You'll make it out
