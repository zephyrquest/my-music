Pull the wool over my eyes
And everything's alright
I tend to just retreat into a world of my own
Where time moves so slow
I have no control of when I'm torn awake and then
Awake and then

Take the fear, lock it up, throw it away
Take it all, what you think you have
Let it go

As night begins to fall, I can't hear you anymore
The look that's on your face
Tells me you will find a way
To break your silence

How tensions ran so high
And feelings sank so low
All the kinds of answers that we'll never get to know
Like a whisper in the wind, where do I begin
Trying to stand up again, up again

Take the fear, lock it up, throw it away
Take it all, what you think you have
Let it go

As night begins to fall, I can't hear you anymore
The look that's on your face
Tells me you will find a way
To break your silence
