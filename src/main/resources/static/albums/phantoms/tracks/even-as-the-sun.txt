I see the problems sticking around
And nothing to be said
I feel the fear that you struck in me
Going to my head

I was never good at saying goodbye
But I knew I had to try
Soon I'll wish that I had left it all alone

Even as the sun goes down
You wait until you know
Till you know

Even as the sky turns black
I'm never coming back

Tried to pick you, oh apart
Couldn't even get a grip
And now I see that it's all for nought
I'm dying to make it stop

I was never good at saying goodbye
But I knew I had to try
Soon I'll wish that I had left it all alone

Even as the sun goes down
You wait until you know
Till you know

Even as the sky turns black
I'm never coming back

I was never good at saying goodbye
But I knew I had to try
I was never good at saying goodbye
But I knew you wouldn't mind
Now I wish that I had left you all
Left you all
Left you all alone

Even as the sun goes down
You wait until you know
Till you know
Even as the sky turns black
I'm never coming back
