I’ve lied one too many times
To people that matter most
Losing friends
And it pains me
Not knowing what to do

I knew it would never work
I tried anyway
Hope is gone
You are gone from me

I can’t make you see me
You are out of reach

You said it would be okay
But there’s nothing you can do
To make me believe you
Not this time

To me, you were everything
A drug for my disease
Addiction kills, it’s killing me
Tonight

I can’t make you see me
You are out of reach

I can’t do this anymore, no
I can’t take this anymore, no

I can’t make you see me
You are out of reach
I can’t make you see me
You are out of reach
