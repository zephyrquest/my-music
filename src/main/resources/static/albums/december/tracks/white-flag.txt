Somehow every move I make
Seemed so true and now it’s wrong
Somehow I let you see
Straight into me

We could be so known
If you would just let me
Show you how I really am
Hide in the shadows
Walking this road

Someday we will end this war
White flags and roses on your name
Someday I won’t let this go
I won’t let this go

We could be so known
If you would just let me
Show you how I really am
Hide in the shadows
Walking this road

You could be so much more than this
I can feel it inside
You could be so much more than this
I can feel it inside

We could be so known
If you would just let me
Show you how I really am
Hide in the shadows
Walking this road
