Falling away
As you can see I’m a shadow of yesterday
Running away
Feeling so alone I’m running from today

I cannot say this
And you cannot know this
I’m not who you think I am
Not this way

I’m looking out the window
Staring back at me, what I should be
Walking through the doorway
Looking over my shoulder up at you

Close my eyes
And tell me this will all be over soon
Whisper lies to make me feel like I’m worth something to you

I cannot say this
And you cannot know this
I’m not who you think I am
Not this way

I’m looking out the window
Staring back at me, what I should be
Walking through the doorway
Looking over my shoulder up at you

I cannot say this
And you cannot know this
I’m not who you think I am
Not this way

I cannot say this
And you cannot know this
I’m not who you think I am
Not this way

I’m looking out the window
Staring back at me, what I should be
Walking through the doorway
Looking over my shoulder up at you

I cannot say this
And you cannot know this
I’m not who you think I am
Not this way
