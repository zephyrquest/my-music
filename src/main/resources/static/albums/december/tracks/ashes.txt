Standing on the crossroads
Again we stray
The ground beneath our feet
Slowly decays

But you are the one that can change all this

There’s nothing for me here
The ashes in your hair remind me
I am slowly losing grip
Losing sight of you

Standing up to you
I’ll bring you back
Falling far beneath
Then into black

But there’s nothing in you that can change all this

There’s nothing for me here
The ashes in your hair remind me
I am slowly losing grip
Losing sight of you

I’m losing this

Losing sight of you

There’s nothing for me here
The ashes in your hair remind me
I am slowly losing grip
Losing sight of you
