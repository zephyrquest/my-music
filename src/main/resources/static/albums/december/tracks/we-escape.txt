Liars rage
They locked me up in here
In my cage
I can’t escape the things

I do to you
I can’t explain away
The things I say
They’re haunting me
And on my shoulder falls
The whole world

Pieces fade
The puzzle stays the same
I’m at the stage
I can’t escape the things

I do to you

And we escape home

Home

Pieces fade
The puzzle stays the same
I’m at the stage
I can’t escape the things

I do to you
I can’t explain away
The things I say
They’re haunting me
And on my shoulder falls
The whole world
