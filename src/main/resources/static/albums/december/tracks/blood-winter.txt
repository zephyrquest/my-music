Holding onto something
Something I cannot define
Though it keeps me going
Steady and clear

Deep, deep in the blood winter
You show yourself to be the queen of ice
Deep in the blood winter
My trust in you to show no pain

And this revelation’s made me all messed up inside
Though I can’t stop wanting you back

Deep, deep in the blood winter
You show yourself to be the queen of ice
Deep in the blood winter
My trust in you to show no pain

Show no pain
Show no pain
Show no pain
Show no pain

Show no pain

Deep, deep in the blood winter
You show yourself to be the queen of ice
Deep in the blood winter
My trust in you to show no pain
