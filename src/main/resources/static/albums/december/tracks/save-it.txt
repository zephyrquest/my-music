But how can I believe you
When what you gave me
Was an icy cold reception
Just go back

Save it
You’re breaking me apart now
Breaking through
Slow down
You’re running all of my dreams
Underground

This is such a hollow ending
To the haunting story
That you began when you deceived me
With the words you wrote

Save it
You’re breaking me apart now
Breaking through
Slow down
You’re running all of my dreams
Underground

Go back to the edge
Back to the place inside
Finding a way
So far away from you
Go back to the edge
Back to the place inside
Wasting your time
Wasting yourself on me

Save it
You’re breaking me apart now
Breaking through
Slow down
You’re running all of my dreams
Underground
