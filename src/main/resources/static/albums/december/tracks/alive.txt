Looking round this place
The faces are so fake
None of this is really working
The final touch you made
Left me feeling cold
Can’t you see?

Is this real?
Till the darkness goes away
I won’t breathe anymore
You’re alive
And you’re telling all your lies
Killing me
You will win

Seeing through your disguise
None of the past applies
And now you don’t even trust me, do you?
The final kiss you gave
Left me feeling cold
Can’t you see?

Is this real?
Till the darkness goes away
I won’t breathe anymore
You’re alive
And you’re telling all your lies
Killing me
You will win

Will you see
What you’ve done
To me?

I can’t say if you will
Let me go

Is this real?
Till the darkness goes away
I won’t breathe anymore
You’re alive
And you’re telling all your lies
Killing me
You will fail
